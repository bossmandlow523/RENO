1. The Split-Screen ArchitectureThe Divider: A strict $50/50$ vertical split using vh: 100.Left Panel (The "Command Center"): Use a background of deep charcoal (#121212) with a subtle grain texture overlay at 5% opacity. This prevents the dark mode from looking "flat."Right Panel (The "Yard"): A high-shutter-speed hero image of a Liebherr magnet crane mid-drop. Apply a greyscale(20%) filter to keep it professional, but allow the orange of the Renovo machinery to pop through.The Seam: A $1px$ vertical line separating the sides, colored in a dim "Galvanized Silver" (#3D3D3D).2. Industrial Typography & MaskingThis is where the "Scrap Smarter" branding comes to life.Headline ("SCRAP SMARTER"):Font: Archivo Black or Public Sans Black. Kerning set to $-0.04em$.The Mask: The word "SCRAP" (spanning the left panel) must use background-clip: text with a high-res video texture of flowing molten copper or shredded aluminum. It should look like the metal is alive inside the letters.The Contrast: The word "SMARTER" (spanning the right panel) switches to a solid, high-visibility "Safety Orange" (#FF6B00).The "Live Rate" Ticker: Positioned at the absolute top (top: 0). A horizontal marquee using linear-gradient edges to fade the text in and out.Content: CU: $3.84/lb (▲2%) | AL: $1.12/lb (▼1%) | BRASS: $2.25/lb (—)3. UI Elements & AccentsPrimary CTA: The button needs to be "Heavy." Use a box-shadow that makes it look like a solid slab of steel bolted to the screen.Hover State: The button should shift $2px$ down and $2px$ right, mimicking the physical "click" of an industrial scale.Navigation: Top right, justified. Instead of standard lines, use a "Diamond Plate" icon for the mobile menu or a simple [ MENU ] in a mono-spaced font (like JetBrains Mono) to lean into the technical/industrial vibe.Vertical Progress: The right-side diamond indicators from the original design should be replaced with a "Load Weight" bar. As the user scrolls, the bar "fills up" like a digital scale readout.4. Motion Logic (The "Renovo" Feel)Intro Sequence: On page load, the right-side image should slide in from the right, while the left-side text "stamps" onto the screen with a scale(1.1) to scale(1.0) transition using a heavy ease-out curve.Parallax Depth: The 3D copper coil (center-aligned) should rotate on the Y-axis based on the user's mouse $X$ position, creating a "glassmorphism" refraction effect over the seam where the two panels meet.Haptic Visuals: Any hover over a "Category" (e.g., Ferrous vs. Non-Ferrous) should trigger a subtle "metal clink" sound effect (if the user has sound enabled) or a high-frequency vibration animation on the text.5. B2B Developer Note: The "Scale" InteractionImplement a Quick-Calc Widget floating at the bottom left.Function: A "Drag & Drop" interaction where contractors can drag a "Copper" icon into a "Scale" area to see an instant ROI estimate based on today's Manatee County market rates.
